## RedFile (redundant file) 

redfile is archiving program, that takes in a file (whose contents warrant extra protection) and produces a larger file with redundant error correcting information. 


For instance if you have a password manager databse file or some pictures or something else that maybe only a few MB in size and you wish to burn it to a DVD for long term storage, There is no reason to waste 90% of the storage available on that disc. Redfile allows you to create a redundant and larger copy such that even if a tiny fraction of the redfile archive survives with time, the orignial content can still be recovered. 


Redfile is in beta at the moment. more info/doc will become available soon after version 1.0 is released.
